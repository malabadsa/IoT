# IoT based Covid-19 temperature monitoring device

The main purpose of this project is to design and implement an IoT prototype device for a local company in order to measure employee’s temperature for Covid-19 monitoring purposes.
This will be achieved by using low-cost micro-controller such as Arduino, the employees will present their RFID card to the device to gain access to the building, the device will measure their body temperature and will allow them to enter the place just if their bodily temperature is within the acceptable range.
IoT devices have added values to people’s life where it allowed them to manage their life automatically and remotely. The internet of Things connectivity is applied in the designed prototype, so the employee’s ID and temperature information will be sent over the local network using a webpage and over the internet.
